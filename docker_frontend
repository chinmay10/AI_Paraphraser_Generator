To deploy the web application using Docker, you will need to do the following:

Create a Dockerfile for the Django backend that specifies the base image, installs the necessary dependencies, and copies the code into the image.

Create a Dockerfile for the React frontend that specifies the base image, installs the necessary dependencies, builds the React app, and copies the built app into the image.

Build the Docker images for the backend and frontend using the docker build command.

Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines the backend and frontend services and the network between them.

Start the services using the docker-compose up command.

Here is an example Dockerfile for the Django backend:

Copy code
FROM python:3.8

# set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# install dependencies
RUN pip install django==3.0
RUN pip install transformers==3.0.0

# copy code into the image
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# run the Django development server
CMD python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
And here is an example Dockerfile for the React frontend:

Copy code
FROM node:14

# set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL http://backend:8000

# install dependencies
COPY package.json .
COPY yarn.lock .
RUN yarn

# copy code into the image
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# build the React app
RUN yarn build

# run the development server
CMD yarn global add serve
CMD serve -s build
